		~~ SPACE SHOOTER ~~

Destroying a whole wave of enemies gives a powerup
Powerups increases your life and upgrade your gun one level
Being hit decreases your life and downgrades your gun. If your gun is level 1, you die on hit.
Asteroids give 10 points, red enemies 100 points, purple enemies 200 points, the boss 1000 points, and killing an entire wave doubles your points
To kill the boss, hit both vulnerabilities (yellow spots) until they dissapear, then hit the red vulnerability to remove health

===========================================================

Compilation info: The game has been developped on Unity 2018.2.7f1, on Windows 10, with .NET Runtimes 4.X
Building should work straight out of the box from the context menu, making sure that the scene Menu is at
index 0 and the scene Game at index 1.
